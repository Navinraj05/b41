    <h1>Mini Project On HTML & CSS</h1>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h3>Read the given instructions given below before doing your project</h3>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>
            <hr>
            <li> The project for your HTML & CSS will be a “mini-web site.” Choose a topic that
                interests you: something that
                excites you, something you want to tell the whole world about.
                If you don’t care about the subject, you readers won’t either. </li>
            <br>
            <li> I want you to concentrate on the HTML, not on finding content, so do not choose a topic that requires
                lots
                of
                research. For example, unless are an expert about the subject, a web site about the kings of Sweden will
                need
                much time-consuming research. On the other hand a website about your favorite hobby won’t take much
                research
                at
            </li>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="h2">h2. Bootstrap heading</p>
        <p>
            Your project must contain a minimum of ten original HTML5 pages (files) that you have written.
            A single HTML5 file with links to nine pages written by other people is not acceptable.
            You may not simply link to pages that you have practiced for the HTML & CSS. Your material must all be
            <br><br>

            Diagram showing links among an index page and other content pages is shown in the Sample linkage diagram.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card" style="width: 30rem;"></div>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        You must draw a diagram showing how your HTML pages link together, and the linkage must make sense. For the
        linkage diagram you can use any online tools to draw or you can make your diagram by hand then scan it or
        take a digital photo of the diagram and upload it to the GitHub.
        <br><br>

        Note: A linkage diagram is not the same as a diagram showing. If you have many pages that are all linked to
        each other, just draw a line that connects them all and label it with words like “all linked to each other”
        rather than trying to draw dozens of lines with arrows on them.
